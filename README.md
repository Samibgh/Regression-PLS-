# Regression-PLS-
**Introduction**

The goal of the project is to create a package reproducing different outputs using PLS Regression, and to display them using a Rshiny application. The PLS Regression is a prediction method in machine learning which was born in 1980 and which knows today many applications in extremely varied domains. She maximizes the variance of the predictors of Xi and maximizes the correlation between the variables that explain the variable Y. The algorithm borrows its approach from both principal component analysis (PCA) and linear regression. More precisely, it looks for the components called latent variables in order to express the regression of Y on the feature variables.
